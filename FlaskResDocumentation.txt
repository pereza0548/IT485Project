* I was successfuly able to implement 31 methods in API 
  request statement/functions, then I used the flask 
  webframeapp/code to display the output on the web,
  instead of a terminal as before. 

* All of them retrieved the desired response in json format.

* I made sure to COMMENT through the code, so that its organized 
  and easy to follow.

* We can decide on how we want to develope the methods calls 
  so that they can go along with the front-end expectaions. 

* Below is the list of methods that I used in the code since    
  they were available on the API documentation page and did
  not require authorization.
