# This code shows the information about an artist, like a biography
# Right now there is no user input, so in the code you can change the artist name -
# - to get info about a different artist

#We have to have a user agent so I just put my name, you can add your key for it to work
API_KEY = ''
USER_AGENT = 'Gabriela'

import requests


#This code I used from the website I was referencing
def lastfm_get(payload):
    # define headers and URL
    headers = {'user-agent': USER_AGENT}
    url = 'https://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/'

    # Add API key and format to the payload
    payload['api_key'] = API_KEY
    payload['format'] = 'json'

    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=payload)
    return response


#This is the part where you can change artist to try it out
#The method can be changed to any method that we need later on, and the artist can be changed too
#I think this part would be where we would ask for user input, like to change artist and method
r = lastfm_get({
    'method': 'artist.getInfo',
    'artist':  'Bad Bunny'
})

#This code makes the output easier to read

    # create a formatted string of the Python JSON object
    text = json.dumps(obj, sort_keys=True, indent=4)
    print(text)

#too many results from just the artist name, so I added the bio key to only print the bio information
jprint(r.json()['artist']['bio'])

# I did get an output that was like a bio, so I think it was good practice
